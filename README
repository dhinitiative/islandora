# 2/5/2014 - SLY - Initial Creation

This suite of software will install a Fedora Commons Repository on a CentOS 6 based server. 

		- Fedora Commons 3.8.1
		- Solr 4.2.0
		- Fedora Gsearch 2.6
		
	Included older scripts. 
		- Islandora 7.x-1.2
		- Drupal 7

This repository was forked from original work at https://github.com/hpcham/islandora. 
The original code in that repository will install fedora commons 3.5, with Drupal and Islandora modules on the same server. 
This is a good setup to get started with this technology but as you start to build collections you will need to separate the different processes onto different servers. 

In order to facilitate better administration of Drupal and Islandora we've made the choice to utilize cPanel (http://cpanel.com) to house our Drupal instances with the Islandora drupal modules. 
With that said, this repository will build a fedora commons server (v3.8.1) with all the parts needed to connect a Drupal/Islandora site to it. 
I've included the original older installation scripts of Drupal and Islandora which you can use at your own risk as they haven't been tested and include older Islandora modules. 

It is recommended that you modify the installer.sh script so that you don't install Drupal and Islandora. 


This software branch is used in the installation of a Fedora Commons Repository server 3.8.1. 

It is installed by running the included installer.sh script. Please modify the script with your 
variables before running it. 


Directory Contents
-------------------

islandora -		Top Level directory. The idea here is this directory 
			holds all of the contents of the installation and 
			has some well known directories within it 
			(sbin,bin,etc,lib). It could be analogous to a 
			/usr/local directory. 

	- bin 		Used to keep useful scripts for managing the 
			repository. Also is where all the dependency 
			packages are linked to. 
			
	- etc		This is where example config files and initial 
			settings are stored. Most notably is the env.sh 
			and database.sh files that declare variables for
			our installation of Islandora. 
	
	- packages	This is the directory where all dependency packages
			are built into. Source code is downloaded into the 
			src directory (this gets created during the install) 
			and compiled in src by declaring a ./configure --prefix=
			/opt/islandora/packages/<package_name>-<version>.
			From this packages directory structure each application 
			is sym-linked into the /opt/islandora/<dir> directories. 
			This way we only have to declare /opt/islandora/bin 
			and /opt/islandora/lib in the environement variables 
			but yet pick up all the applications we build manually. 
	
	- sbin		This is where all the scripts to do the islandora 
			installation scripts are stored. Once the 
			installation is running you would generally just 
			use bin to add in extra scripts as you develop them. 
			
	- .bash_profile	This file is set up to source the whole environment 
			if you set the home directory of the local fedora user 
			to this location (ie. /opt/islandora).
			
		
Installation:

	1.) on a fresh CentOS 6 based server clone the git repository
	
		% cd /opt
		% git clone https://github.com/dhinitiative/islandora.git
		% cd islandora
		
	2.) Modify installer.sh with your information
	
		% vi installer.sh
	
	3.) Execute the build
	
		% chmod 755 installer.sh; ./installer.sh
	
	4.) Wait for machine to build as it might take a while to build everything depending on your server resources.
