Islandora
=========

 This suite of software will install an Islandora Repository Server. 

		- Fedora Commons 3.5
		- Islandora 7.x-1.2
		- Drupal 7

It is assumed that you have created two MySQL databases. One for Drupal and one for Fedora Commons. 

This software branch is used in the installation of Islandora, fedora, drupal.

It is called from a RedHat based kickstart server installer (https://github.com/hamhpc/kickstart/blob/master/ks_islandora.cfg)

(note: you can comment out the kickstart portion of the above file and run it directly as a script). 

Directory Contents
-------------------

islandora -		Top Level directory. The idea here is this directory holds all of the contents of the 
			installation and has some well known directories within it (sbin,bin,etc,lib). It could be analogous to 
			a /usr/local directory. 

	- bin 		Used to keep useful scripts for managing the repository. Also is where all the 
			dependency packages are linked to.
